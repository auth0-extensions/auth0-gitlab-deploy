# Auth0 GitLab Deployments

Beginning with the [2.7] release of this extension, we have moved from separate repositories for each the deployment extensions (github, gitlab, bitbucket, and visualstudio) to building and deploying via a single `auth0-deploy-extensions` monorepo. This will make them much easier to maintain and keep track of fixes across all four extensions.
> The new monorepo can be found here: [auth0-deploy-extensions](https://github.com/auth0-extensions/auth0-deploy-extensions)
